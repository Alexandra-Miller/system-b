; this is a program that finds c for ;

FLP 4       ; 0x00  this flips the value a
ADD 4 5 4   ; 0x01  this adds one to a
ADD 3 4 6   ; 0x02  this adds a to b, and places the ansewer c in address 0x6
0           ; 0x03  this stores the value a
0           ; 0x04  this stores the value of b
1           ; 0x05  this is where the one is stored for the add one operation
